## ⚙️ Configuration

### Getting the config in place

Download the `neobrutal-zebar.zip` from the latest release. Unzip the contents
inside your zebar config directory.

### Replacing values

In order for imports to work you will need to update some paths in the files

#### 1. config.yaml

In order for zebar to able to import the css file, you need to url encode all
special character, this can be done via services like https://www.urldecoder.org/.

For instance if you zebar config is stored at
_C:/Users/MyCoolUsername/.glzr/zebar_. Your import link would look like this:
`http://asset.localhost/C:/Users/MyCoolUsername/.glzr/zebar/styles/global.css`.
Everything following `localhost/` needs to be url encoded for the import to work
inside the yaml. This would mean that you would take _C:/Users/MyCoolUsername/.glzr/zebar/styles/global.css_
and paste it to https://www.urldecoder.org/ and replace the import with that string.
The resulting string will then look like this: _"http://asset.localhost/C%3A%2FUsers%2FMyCoolUsername%2F.glzr%2Fzebar%2Fstyles%2Fglobal.css"_

```yaml
# Change the following line to match your path
@import "http://asset.localhost/>> PATH TO YOUR YOUR GLZR CONFIG FOLDER<<.glzr%2Fzebar%2Fstyles%2Fglobal.css";
```

#### 2. styles/global.css 

```css
/* Change the following imports, you don't need to url encode these like in config.yaml */
@import "http://asset.localhost/>> PATH TO YOUR YOUR GLZR CONFIG FOLDER<</.glzr/zebar/styles/themes/rose-pine.css";
@import "http://asset.localhost/>> PATH TO YOUR YOUR GLZR CONFIG FOLDER<</.glzr/zebar/styles/config.css";
@import "http://asset.localhost/>> PATH TO YOUR YOUR GLZR CONFIG FOLDER<</.glzr/zebar/styles/animations.css";
@import "http://asset.localhost/>> PATH TO YOUR YOUR GLZR CONFIG FOLDER<</.glzr/zebar/styles/bar.css";
@import "http://asset.localhost/>> PATH TO YOUR YOUR GLZR CONFIG FOLDER<</.glzr/zebar/styles/group-left.css";
@import "http://asset.localhost/>> PATH TO YOUR YOUR GLZR CONFIG FOLDER<</.glzr/zebar/styles/group-center.css";
@import "http://asset.localhost/>> PATH TO YOUR YOUR GLZR CONFIG FOLDER<</.glzr/zebar/styles/group-right.css";
```

### Configuring CSS-variables

In `styles/config.css` there exists a lot of configuration available to tweak.
